<h2>Charlie is my rescue dog, he turns 11 years old in April</h2>
<h3>How did we adopt Charlie?</h3>
<p class="paragraph" id="p1" >
    We adopted Charlie from an animal sanctuary in North Manchetser.
    Charlie came into the sanctuary with his sisters after someone abandoned them whislt they were still only puppies.
    After heading to the sanctuary to donate food, we came accross Charlie! After meeting Charlie
    we decided to take him home with us.
